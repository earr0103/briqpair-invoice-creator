# 🎮 BriqPair - Your Friendly Business Helper!

Hi there! Welcome to BriqPair, a super cool app that helps businesses manage their stuff! Let me explain what it does in a fun way 🚀

## 🎯 What Does BriqPair Do?

Imagine you have a toy store. BriqPair helps you:
- Keep track of all your toys (that's your inventory!)
- Sell toys to customers (that's making orders!)
- Create bills (we call them invoices!)
- See how much money you made (that's your dashboard!)

## 🎨 Main Parts of BriqPair

### 1. 🏠 Dashboard (Home Page)
When you first open BriqPair, you'll see:
- How many sales you made this week
- Which toys are selling the most (trending products)
- Pretty charts showing your money
- How people like to pay (credit card, cash, etc.)

### 2. 📦 Inventory Page
This is where you:
- See all your toys
- Add new toys
- Change how many toys you have
- Set prices for toys

### 3. 🛒 Orders Page
Here you can:
- Search for toys by their name or special code (SKU)
- Add toys to your shopping cart
- Make new orders
- The cool part: When someone buys a toy, it automatically:
  - Removes it from your inventory
  - Creates a bill (invoice)
  - Updates your dashboard!

### 4. 📄 Invoices Page
This shows you:
- All the bills you made
